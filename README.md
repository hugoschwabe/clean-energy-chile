<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<h2>ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡± Scenario Analysis of a 100% Renewable Energy System for Chile (2013)</h2>

<p>This repository contains a university project exploring the feasibility of a fully renewable energy system for Chile in the base year 2013. The analysis is performed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook, leveraging the open-source <strong>PyPSA</strong> package for power system modeling.</p>

<h3>ðŸ“Š What the Project Does</h3>

<p>The project performs a multi-step analysis using real-world datasets (included in the <code>data/</code> folder), aiming to estimate the technical and economic potential of wind and solar power in Chile. The key steps are:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Land Eligibility Analysis</strong><br>
      Filters regions based on land cover classes to identify suitable areas for renewable installations.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Capacity Factor Time Series Calculation</strong><br>
      Derives wind and solar capacity factors using point-in-time wind speed and solar radiation data.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Building the PyPSA Model</strong><br>
      Constructs an energy model incorporating:
      <ul>
        <li>Renewable generation potential</li>
        <li>Existing power plant data</li>
        <li>Historical electricity demand</li>
        <li>Simplified regional power transmission</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>System Optimization</strong><br>
      Runs a cost-minimizing optimization to:
      <ul>
        <li>Simulate hourly generation</li>
        <li>Determine required battery and hydrogen storage capacities</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Results & Insights</strong><br>
      Interprets the optimized system design and discusses trade-offs, limitations, and future potential for renewables in Chile.
  </li>
</ol>
